In summary:</p> <p>A dev container is a lightweight, isolated environment used for software development. In our case we will be using Visual Studio Code's Dev Container extension in conjunction with Docker to setup our dev container within VS Code.</p> <p>Why is this useful? Well, projects can become vast and complex pretty quickly, which introduce different dependencies, libraries, programming languages, and other tools that are specifically required to have a project function correctly. With dev containers, projects can be outsourced to different team members to quickly work in a consistent, bug free environment that also reduces onboarding and time doing manual setup to start coding within a project. </p> <p>All we need to is to define a configuration file for VS Code's Dev Container extension to read and create a container with the Docker software application. With that, let's get started!</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>If you do not have Docker installed and tested, please refer back to the prerequisities at the top of this page.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open VS Code and open your rust-dev-container folder to start development.</p> </li> <li> <p>Install the Dev Containers extension that will be used to read our configuration file we will make shortly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a folder called .devcontainer and insert a file called devcontainer.json. This json file will be used to hold information for the VS Code extension to tell Docker what will be needed to run our Rust program.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Within this configuration file we will need to define a few things:</p> <p><code>name</code>: Which is the name of our container. It is good to make this descriptive.  </p> <p><code>image</code>: Image refers to the Docker image that will be used to run the dependencies that are needed for this project. We will need a base image that will compile our Rust code to run.  </p> <p><code>customizations</code>: This specifier allows extensions and other configurations to automatically be downloaded within the dev container. We will need the rust-analyzer extension installed.  </p> <p><code>postCreatecommand</code>: These are the commands we will need to run after our container is created to make sure our Rust is up to date and that we have a recent version aftwards.</p> <p>Your devcontainer.json file should now have this:</p> <pre><code>    {\n  \"name\": \"dev container for rust. HELLO COMP423\",\n  \"image\": \"mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/rust:1-1-bullseye\",\n  \"postCreateCommand\": \"rustup update &amp;&amp; rustc --version\",\n  \"customizations\": {\n    \"vscode\": {\n      \"extensions\": [\n        \"rust-lang.rust-analyzer\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>rust-lang.rust-analyzer VSCode Extension</p> <p>This extension enhances Rust development with features like code completion, error checking, inlay hints, and syntax highlighting. It integrates with the Rust toolchain, offering tools like Go to Definition and code navigation, making coding more efficient and productive.</p> <p>Great! Now all we have to do is have VS Code read our configuration file to download our Rust image from Microsoft which will reopen our directory as a development container with everything needed to run rust.</p> <ol> <li>Hit CTRL + Shift + P on Windows (or CMD + Shift + P on Mac) and run \"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container\".</li> </ol> <p>Afterwards you should see in your terminal something similar to this:</p> <p><pre><code>Running the postCreateCommand from devcontainer.json...\n\n[5329 ms] Start: Run in container: /bin/sh -c rustup update &amp;&amp; rustc --version\ninfo: no updatable toolchains installed\ninfo: checking for self-update\ninfo: cleaning up downloads &amp; tmp directories\nrustc 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)\n\nWhat's next:\n    Try Docker Debug for seamless, persistent debugging tools in any container o\nr image \u2192 docker debug 4bc6325493dc8cdfa23e7f2b83243ee6720366d1a63428513577abaec\na72d958\n    Learn more at https://docs.docker.com/go/debug-cli/\nDone. Press any key to close the terminal.\n</code></pre> The Rust version  should be <code>rustc 1.83.0</code> or higher (depending on when you are following this tutorial).</p> <p>Congratulations! You are now ready to create a standard Rust project and create some really cool code!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#building-a-rust-project-for-hello-comp423","title":"Building a Rust Project for Hello COMP423","text":"<ol> <li>In your terminal run:</li> </ol> <p><pre><code>cargo new hello_world --vcs none\n</code></pre> This will tell Rust to make a new Rust project with the necessary file structure. <code>--vcs none</code> makes sure a new git repository isn't initialized in that directory.</p> <p>Now you should see a directory called hello_world, with a src folder and Cargo.toml that is used to define dependencies for the Rust project. Under src, you will see main.rs that has a hello world program that you will be able to run! Let's change what it prints out now to:</p> <pre><code>fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello COMP423\");\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now you will need to go into the hello_world directory. In your terminal, run <code>cd hello_world</code>.</p> <p>Afterwards, run <code>cargo build</code>, which is similar to how C uses <code>gcc</code> to compile C into binary. Both will utilize their respective compilers to turn their code files into binary executables a computer can execute.</p> <p>Now there should be a directory called \"target\" within your Rust project that will hold your built executable. To run it, we have to describe the file path along with <code>./</code> to tell our computer to run the binary exectuable. This is <code>./target/debug/hello_world</code>.</p> <p>You should now see <code>Hello COMP423</code> to the stdout. Hooray!!!!</p> <p>We can do all of these steps actually in one. To do this we can run, <code> cargo run </code> which does both compile, create the executable, and run all in one command. So, <code>cargo build</code> actually creates the binary executable, while <code>cargo run</code> does so and runs the executable.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Make sure to commit and push your changes to your remote repository so that you can always come back and write some more Rust code!
